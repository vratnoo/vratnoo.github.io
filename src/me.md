## Hi, I am vikram Ratnoo

I am a web developer from Rajasthan, India, with a passion for creating dynamic and user-friendly websites. My journey in web development began with learning Php, and later I expanded my skills to include Python, Flask and now React and Express.

In addition to my web development skills, I have also acquired knowledge in data structure and algorithms. I believe that understanding these concepts is essential for creating efficient and performant websites.

Besides coding, I am also interested in books, science, web technology, machine learning and AI. I am an avid learner, and I am always looking to expand my knowledge and skills.

I am currently in the learning phase, continuously striving to improve my skills and develop my knowledge in web development and related fields.

Thank you for visiting my page!
